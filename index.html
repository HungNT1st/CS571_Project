            <div class="temp-content">
                <p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is when a foreign company invests in a country's businesses or assets, 
                    often by establishing operations or acquiring local firms. It plays a vital role in economic growth by creating jobs, boosting productivity, 
                    and introducing new technologies. Looking at FDI by province helps highlight regional strengths and uncover areas that need more support. 
                    This information guides policymakers in attracting investment and promoting balanced development across the country.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) measures the quality of governance and 
                    public service delivery across provinces based on citizen surveys. It covers areas like transparency, accountability, public participation, and control of corruption. 
                    Tracking PAPI helps identify strengths and weaknesses in local governance, guiding reforms and policy improvements. Comparing scores across provinces encourages 
                    healthy competition and supports more responsive, citizen-centered governance.</p>
